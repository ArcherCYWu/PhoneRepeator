# PhoneRepeator
relays sms and phone calls from 1 to another via internet.

the initiative of this project is to satisfy my requirement of sustaining my old phone number that registered in my original country from australia - i would like to have all the sms and the alerts of received phone calls on an android phone, which hosts my old phone number, relayed to my iphone, which i used primarily with my australian phone number.

ultimately this project will support responding sms from my iphone as well.
